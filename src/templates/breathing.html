        <li>Don't worry if you can't keep up. Just breathe as slowly and deeply as you can. Allow yourself some time to get into a regular rhythm.</li><br>
        <li>Keep doing this for two to five minutes or until you feel better. The longer you breathe deeply, the calmer you will feel!</li><br>
