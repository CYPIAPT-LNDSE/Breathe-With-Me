# Breathing with Kitty


This app helps young people to manage anxiety, offer support and build resilience through the breathing techniques that appear as interactive animations. Children and young people will have the tools at their fingertips to reduce anxiety, monitor their wellbeing and manage their mental state in between appointments and away from services.

The application is expected to be used at home or whenever it is needed. It may be deployed in a therapy session. This application is available and applicable to all, not just those children currently accessing CAMHS.

## Why?

Anxiety is a feeling of fear or panic. According to Anxiety UK, as many as 1 in 6 young people will experience an anxiety problem at some point in their life. Young people with anxiety usually experience anxiety in three ways:

* generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
* panic attacks
* phobias

GAD alone affects 1 in 25 people in the UK and young people who have GAD worry a lot of the time and the anxiety makes doing everyday things difficult.  

## Who?

Breathing with Kitty is aimed at young people age 10-14 who are able to take self-directed learning. Although primarily aimed at those CYP accessing services, this app could also be used as a general wellbeing tool for CYP in the same age group.  The app will be publicly available and therefore is a public asset to promote self-care and methods to reduce anxiety through breath focus.

## What?

The first iteration of this application, during the development of the working prototype, will focus on providing a solution for GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder).

Core features will include:

* User account with login and password
* Storage of name so that user is greeted at each login
* Instructions on how to practice deep abdominal breathing
* Animation of breathing of a kitty to which users will sync their breathing. This forms the core of the animated game ‘Breathing with Kitty’.
* Rewards system via gold stars which users collect after each game


## Built With

The initial prototype will be developed as a PWA for full accessibility.
